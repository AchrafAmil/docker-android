docker-android is aiming to provide general purpose docker images to run CI steps of Android project.
It should work out of the box on any CI/CD service providing docker support.
CI/CD service status:

## Usage
docker-android images are hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fabernovel/android).

We provide stable and snapshot variants for latest Android API levels, including or not native SDK.
We use the following tagging policy:
`API-NDK-VERSION`
* `API` the Android API to use, like `api-28`, `api-29`
* `NDK` is the presence or not of the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) in the image
* `VERSION` is the image version. Check [Versions](https://github.com/faberNovel/docker-android/tree/feature/documentation#versions)

## Versions
* `snapshot` versions are build on each push on `develop` branch
* Release versions `v*` on each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/faberNovel/docker-android/releases)

## Images
Image description is provided as asset with each [GitHub Release](https://github.com/faberNovel/docker-android/releases).
